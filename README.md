System Overview: 

The program will sell CDs to customers via an E-commerce site. Customers will have access to the front end of the program allowing them to browse and filter in stock CDs. The customer will have the option to buy CDs by placing them into a shopping cart and creating an order. To place an order a customer will require an account with their personal details, if a customer does not have an account, they must create one. The customer should be able to review and modify orders. 

The program will also have a staff only access back end. Once an order is created by the customer, the order is added to a list of other orders ready for processing by staff. The back end allows for admin functions such as managing customer data, stock and running various reports on data stored in the system such as orders placed.
